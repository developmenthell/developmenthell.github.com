This episode was recorded at the [tek12](http://tek12.phparch.com) uncon in front of a live studio audience. We talk about [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming), what we'd recommend to folks who want to start programming, the [PHP-FIG](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/php-standards) & [PSRs](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards), and our favorite events from [tek12](http://tek12.phparch.com). Also Chris punched Ed a couple times. It hurt.

Video hosting for this episode is provided by [WonderNetwork](https://wondernetwork.com), who generate some really cool [ping data](https://wondernetwork.com/pings/).

This was lots of fun, and we want to thank all the folks who came out and participated.

Extra special big thanks to [Michelangelo Van Dam](http://www.dragonbe.com/) for lending us his audio recording hardware, and [Cal Evans](http://blog.calevans.com/) for recording the video!
