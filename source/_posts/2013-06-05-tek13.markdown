At this year's [tek13](http://tek.phparch.com/) we did another live show. The difference this time is that we didn't have free booze, so turnout was a little low, but it was still super fun. We talked about hobbies we have outside of coding and how they impact our dev skills (hint: minimally), and what folks favorite talks at tek13 were. Probably other stuff too, but it's been a while and I forgot.
