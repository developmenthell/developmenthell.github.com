This week the gruesome twosome talk about working remotely:

* the tools you need to make it work
* the problems of being the Remote Guy when everyone else is local
* techniques for staying focused
* being a goddamn adult and [GTTFD](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sizemore/453953576/)
* why a company should invest the time in being remote-friendly

Chris also talks a bit about his new gig at Kaplan, where he'll surely make grown men cry.
