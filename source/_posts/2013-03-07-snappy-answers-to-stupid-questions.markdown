Being totally out of ideas, we turned things over to our legions of fans who joined us on [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=devhell&uio=d4). Lots of interesting questions, and people learned what Ed thought was horseshit.

Special thanks to [Joel Clermont](https://twitter.com/jclermont) for killing
