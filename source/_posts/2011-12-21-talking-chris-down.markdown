Doing something the second time is always the toughest, but we somehow managed
to get our act together for a second episode of "Development Hell".

Our hosts [Chris](http://twitter.com/chartjes) and [Ed](http://twitter.com/funkatron)
got together and discussed whatever was on their minds that night. Thanks to
Ed for doing a masterful job of editing the results of using my crappy headset
for the conversation.

Summary of the show:

* Git and git workflows
* Node.js vs. Twisted/Tornado
* How being opinionated and objective about a topic is impossible
* Building your online brand
