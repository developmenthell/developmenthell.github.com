[![Empty Pockets by Terry Johnston](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/227/500770785_972d2cd223.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/powerbooktrance/500770785/ "Empty Pockets by Terry Johnston")

This time out we are blessed by the presence of [Joël Perras](http://nerderati.com/me/), PHP developer extraordinaire and [Fictive Kin](http://fictivekin.com) brosef of Ed. We explore Joël's rags-to-riches story: a young academic schlepping coffee and 44oz soft drinks at a gas station, where he's discovered by a grizzled dev team manager in need of Java skills. From there it's been a whirlwind of web sites, programming languages, and more ops than you can shake a stick at.

Actually I was sleepy and wasn't really listening for the first half-hour. I bet it's good though.

Feel free to hit us up on Twitter at [@dev_hell](https://twitter.com/dev_hell)
or harass [Ed](https://twitter.com/funkatron) and
[Chris](https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer) directly.
