The first episode of 2013 find Chris and Ed talking about the tragedy of Aaron Swartzs' suicide, both in the context of governmental power and mental illness. We also talk about Ed's favorite (and only tolerable) Apple-related podcast ending. Finally, Ed rambles about SASS, a superset of CSS3 that makes writing CSS less painful.
