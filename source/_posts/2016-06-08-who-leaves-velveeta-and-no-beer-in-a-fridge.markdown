It's rare that we have some folks who work for the same employer back-to-back
on the show, but this time out we spoke with Jessica Rose. Jessica is [Tracy Osborne's](https://twitter.com/limedaring) boss (Tracy was on the show in
Episode 77) and talked about her own experiences creating a different kind of
developer relations team at Dream Factory.

Along the way we found out how much better Chris handled jet lag at the same
Australian conference Jessica was at and how thankful she is her husband pays
zero attention to Twitter.
