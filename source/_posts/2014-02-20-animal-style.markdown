Okay, first off, this episode sounds like crap. We weren't really prepared to record and used half-assed equipment and stuff. Sorry guys. It should at least be listenable.

Anyway, this was recorded the night before [SkiPHP](https://www.skiphp.com) started, which was an awesome PHP conference in Salt Lake City. We ramble about a lot of stuff, including our first conferences, America's first serial killer, our approaches for giving talks, and Chris' secret identity.
