Two Chrises? God help us. Our guest this episode is Chris Fidao, creator of the ultra-successful and awesome <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/">Servers For Hackers</a> web site and e-book. We talk about info products (because Chris has to talk about his money making schemes all the time), what devs should know about devops, Nginx vs. Apache vs. Your Mom, and old tech that keeps on keeping on. Also an update of Gary Hockin's ongoing embezzlement campaign.
