**UPDATE Nov 28 2012:** We fixed a bad error in the original audio file. Please [re-download](http://devhell.s3.amazonaws.com/ep23-64mono.mp3) to get the corrected file

Episode 23 is packed chock-full of awesome guests. We talk about the controversy around the cancellation of BritRuby, and the larger issues of diversity and inclusiveness at tech conferences, with [Ashe Dryden](http://ashedryden.com/) and [Reg Braithwaite](http://braythwayt.com/). We also get into the goofiness of Star Trek and the wonder of railroad games.
