Guest-less and listless, Chris and Ed slouch their way back to their studios. Chris talks about the time he tried to murder a disabled woman with his new luxury sedan, we discuss artisanal PHP-Nuke sites, and how we got our local user groups started. Then It *really* goes off the rails with a discussion of the awesomeness of Dragon Age: Inquistion, and what happens to games and other services that rely on Internet connectivity.

*Correction: It looks like Ultima Online and Phantasy Star Online are still up!*
