This time out we had PHP community icon Cal "Doesn't Follow Chris On Twitter"
Evans on to discuss the traveling minstrel show known as NomadPHP, the awesomeness of Day Camp 4 Developers, his thoughts on how Mailchimp handled The Mandrill Issue, and helped trigger Chris in to an epic rant. Chris also hopes that Cal has not noticed he hadn't finished that thing he was supposed to do for him yet. It will be done really soon!
