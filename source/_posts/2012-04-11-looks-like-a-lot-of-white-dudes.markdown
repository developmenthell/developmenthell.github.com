No guest would permit themselves to be shamed in the typical /dev/hell manner this week, so this time around you're stuck with the gruesome twosome. We hit on a few topical topics in this episode, including a dude scoring Internet Ego Points for saying PHP sucks ([really?](http://devhell.info/post/2011-12-10/what-we-hate-about-php/)), the "technology preview" of [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) (no, not [that Meteor](http://meteorserver.org/)), and an Important Startup Guy who says that remote working is *baaaaaaad*. Plus we say "horseshit" a lot.
