In our fifth episode we speak to our first ever guest [Brian Moon](https://twitter.com/brianlmoon), ancient PHP elder of [dealnews](http://dealnews.com) and someone who has probably forgotten more about PHP than our two hosts will ever know. Chris admires his stamina for staying with the same employer for 14 years and counting.

In this episode we talk about dealnews, how they use PHP (and how they also use it in some interesting ways), and his thoughts on issues like concurrency and evented systems. We also cover features of PHP that allowed for some major changes and approaches they used in the code base for the site.
