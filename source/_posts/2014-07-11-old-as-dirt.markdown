Our guest this week is [Elizabeth Smith](http://emsmith.net/), PHP internals veteran and guru of PHP on Windows (she says **"I wish every company was as good at giving back to open source as Microsoft"**). We talk about being Old as Dirt in relation to [a blog post Ed made last week](http://j.mp/devdystopia), how to mentor up and coming developers, and the history of PHP on Windows.
