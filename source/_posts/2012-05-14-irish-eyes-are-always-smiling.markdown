Through a haze of jägerbombs and extreme fatigue, we were able to shovel out another pile of podcast for your listening enjoyment. This week we talk about:

* Apple's magical devices, and what's holding back Android from being comparable
* How Rackspace completely and repeatedly dropped the ball
* Fun times with Python, and the value of defining guiding principles in an open source project
