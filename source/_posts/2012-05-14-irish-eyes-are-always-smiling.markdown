Through a haze of jägerbombs and extreme fatigue, we were able to shovel out another pile of podcast for your listening enjoyment. Chris says it's episode 11 when it's actually episode 12, but hey! This week we talk about:

* Apple's magical devices, and what's holding back Android from being comparable
* How Rackspace completely and repeatedly dropped the ball
* Fun times with Python, and the value of defining guiding principles in an open source project

Here's your homework for this week:
