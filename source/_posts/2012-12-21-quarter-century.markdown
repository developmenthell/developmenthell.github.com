It has now been 25 times that Ed and Chris have fired up Skype
and talked to each other and some friends, old and new, about
whatever the hell they felt like talking about.

They would keep doing this even if nobody else listened, because
developer misery loves company. Thank you to everyone who has
been listening to us work out our own issues with the technologies
that help shovel money into our bank accounts.

In this episode Ed talked about his experiences at CodeConnex,
Chris tried to goad Ed into further ranting and arguments about
the latest round of push-backs against the microframework manifesto
and people crying about other people crying about dependencies in
their code.

The show then ended with Ed speaking about the very real challenge
of creating awesome infinite scrolling experiences, which made
Chris realize he is better off learning Javascript just to use
Node and avoid the mess that is the DOM.

As always, thank you to our awesome sponsors at [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com)
and [Wonder Network](http://wondernetworks.com) for providing 
cashmoney and bandwidth for our live stream, respectively.
