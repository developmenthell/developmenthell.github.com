After a couple weeks off, we get back into the profane swing of things. We kick off with alittle followup on the [previous episode on mental illness](/post/2012-06-18/whack-job-central/), but decide to quit bumming everybody out by moving on to cool tech stuff. Ed talks a little about Reaper, a new digital audio workstation he's using to do production on the podcast. Then we chat about remote pair programming with browser-based editors like Cloud9. Finally we cover Chris' experiences at Lonestar PHP, and what each of us gets out of speaking at conferences.
