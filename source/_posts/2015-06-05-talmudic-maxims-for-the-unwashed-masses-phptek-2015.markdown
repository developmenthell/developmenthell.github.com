**phptek 2015** featured an awesome live recording of Development Hell in front of a rowdy audience. Our special guest Yitzchok Willroth, aka coderabbi, drops Talmudic knowledge on us, and we have great discussions about "hard" and "soft" talks, tech vs personal skills, and had a great Q&A session with the audience.

Note that the audio quality isn't quite up to our usual standards here. Recording live can be hard -- sorry about the background noise!
