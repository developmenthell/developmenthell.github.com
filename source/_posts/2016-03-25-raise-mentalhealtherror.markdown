In this episode we were extremely lucky to get [Kenneth Reitz](http://www.kennethreitz.org/)
on the show to discuss his experiences when he had a mental health event that
resulted in a stay in the hospital and some major life changes as a result.

Normally we're a comedy podcast that focusses on technology, but issues
surrounding mental health are very important to us. We're extremely grateful
that Kenneth came on and was very open about what happened to him.

We hope you enjoy what was a great, open, freewheeling discussion about
how the symptoms of some mental illnesses appear beneficial from the outside.
