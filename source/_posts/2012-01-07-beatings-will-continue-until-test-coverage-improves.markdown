Fresh off our holiday break, we're back with our longest show yet. We talk about Chris' new book [*The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications*](http://leanpub.com/grumpy-testing), including his experiences self-publishing with [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/grumpy-testing). Chris also explpains how he fears no precipitation on his excursions to the Codemash conference in Ohio. Then Ed talks about the thought process that lead to his latest shit-stirring blog post "[The MicroPHP Manifesto](http://funkatron.com/posts/the-microphp-manifesto.html)." Ed may or may not begin crying openly. Finally, we discuss when it might be necessary to trash your existing application and rewrite it.
