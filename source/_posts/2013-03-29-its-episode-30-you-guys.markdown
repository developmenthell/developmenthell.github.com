In our action-packed 30th episode Ed and Chris discussed their experiences
with JavaScript testing tools, specifically how certain tools push you towards
specific refactoring patterns.

Chris talked about the successful launch of his [latest book on using PHPUnit](http://grumpy-phpunit.com)
and got into some honest talk about revenue and how the [product development course](http://unicornfree.com/30x500)
helped him make this book do 4 times the launch day revenue of his previous one.

Ed discussed his plans to [talk about mental illness](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/open-sourcing-mental-illness)
on the conference circuit this year. Please help out by donating to the campaign!
