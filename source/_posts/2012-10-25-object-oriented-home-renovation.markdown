We hit the Double Deuce this week with special guest Chris Gay. Chris is the author of Clean Ruby, the upcoming book that applies "Data, Context and Interaction" (DCI) concepts to Ruby and Rails development. Chris is clearly much smarter than us, so we took this opportunity to attack him mercilessly as a representative of the sexist Ruby community. Chris also shares his experiences as a self-published author. In addition, we talk about how True North PHP planning is going for Chris, and Ed's experiences at Brooklyn Beta.
