This time out we asked our listeners to submit some questions because we are
tired of winning so much and wanted to let others get in on it. Along the
way Ed talked about a recent computer-related purchase he made on eBay while
Chris talked about one the earliest science fiction short stories he can
remember while feeling incredibly old at the same time.

Don't worry, Chris' ego let him know he was not old and is still awesome.
