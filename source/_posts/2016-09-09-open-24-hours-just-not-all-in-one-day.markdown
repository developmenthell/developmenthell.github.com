In this scintillating episode Chris and Ed shift gears and talk about their own

# Links and Notes

* Chris' work at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org) generally ends up in their [Mozilla Services GitHub repo](https://github.com/mozilla-services)
* When Ed's [employer](https://graphstory.com) does open source things, they fall under the [Graph Story repo](https://github.com/graphstory)
* Mozilla is using [TestPilot](https://testpilot.firefox.com/) to test new features for their browsers
* Opera had a pretty nasty [security breach](https://www.opera.com/blogs/security/2016/08/opera-server-breach-incident/)
* Ed mentioned that one of Graph Story's open source projects is a [iOS Neo4J library](https://github.com/GraphStory/neo4j-ios)
* Ed is also getting better at branding -- GLOSSY has been renamed [HackLafayette](https://www.meetup.com/hacklafayette) despite Chris saying it should be called G-POSSY
