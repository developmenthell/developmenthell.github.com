So our pace is a little slower due to work crap, but DEV HELL LIVES. Episode 6d6 kicks off with us waxing about what's exciting in PHP development nowadays. We also talk about upcoming appearances at TrueNorth PHP, NomadPHP and SkiPHP. Then we get into the discussion of alcohol consumption at tech conferences, and malware on the PHP.net site.
