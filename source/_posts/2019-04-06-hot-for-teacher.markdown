As we slouch along towards episode 100, we do something we normally don't do and have a guest on to try and sell a book they've written.

This time out we spoke with Dane Hillard, who is in the process of finishing a book about Python programming for folks who are new to programming. Dane shared his experiences writing the book and why he feels there is a gap in help out there for folks who are looking to add programming to their problem-solving toolkit.
