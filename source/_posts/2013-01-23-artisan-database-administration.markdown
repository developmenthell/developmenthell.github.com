This episode marks a return, both for special guest Selena Deckelmann, and our special hand-made artisan podcasting. Know that this episode was made with locally-sourced bytes, harvested with care and respect for the Earth. We talk with Selena about working at Mozilla, her switch to Linux on the desktop, and how marketing is weightier than merit in determining a product's success.

This episode's super-special sponsor is EasyBib! They are looking for junior and senior PHP devs to work on their awesome academic web app. [Check out the job description](http://gun.io/careers/1157/junior-senior-php-developers) and email stuff to <mailto:till+php@imagineeasy.com>.

As always, thank you to our awesome sponsors at [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com)
and [Wonder Network](http://wondernetworks.com) for providing 
cashmoney and bandwidth for our live stream, respectively.
