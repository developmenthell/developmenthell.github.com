<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and that&rsquo;s why this podcast is rated M for mature&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chris and Ed talk about their thoughts on what might have to change once you
become &ldquo;internet famous&rdquo; and a reminder that even if you have made mistakes
in the past, you can choose to correct them in the future.</p>

<p>We also include a new segment called &ldquo;What toys did we buy?&rdquo; to reflect how
the hosts numb the pain of every day living through conspicuous consumption.</p>

<p>Thanks to Chance Garcia for allowing us to bring another health issue to people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
