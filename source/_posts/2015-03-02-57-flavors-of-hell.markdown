This episode we are joined by PHP *whiz kid* Anthony Ferrara to discuss recent happenings on PHP Internals, where a productive community member stepped away entirely. We discuss the merits of the proposals (particularly the controversial Scalar Type Hints RFC), and what the PHP community could be doing better to prevent contributor burnout. Also I guess we talked about baby animals...?
