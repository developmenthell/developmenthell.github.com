Our latest episode was special in two ways: we recorded video of it, and it was a simulcast with our friends at the [PHP Town Hall](http://phptownhall.com/) podcast. What great people! They're still wrong, but that's okay. We talk about mouthing off in public, whether async features should be built into PHP, and the appropriate ways to encourage people to use current versions of PHP. Then Chris gets mad.
