In a great feat of strength we were lucky enough to have future [Digital Prophet](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=aol+digital+prophet&t=ffab) Samantha Quinones join us to
talk about how she got involved with the PHP community and what it's like to
work for a company who's office is constructed out of [old CD's](http://www.bitsandpieces.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/aol-cd.jpg).

Along the way we talked about ways to discuss AOL with your millenial, her close
personal relationship with the ["You've Got Mail" Guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwood_Edwards),
and how to sell tampons using caching and firehoses. Ed also shared his latest
updates about [OSMI](http://osmihelp.org/). Naturally there was also time to
make fun of [Chris' new employer](http://mozilla.org)
