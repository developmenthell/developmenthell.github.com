This week we're joined by [Justin Searls](http://about.me/searls), JavaScript developer and JS testing EXPERT. We talk lots about building and testing "fat" browser apps, particularly about best practices and different testing approaches. After a while Chris felt bad and told us to shut up.

This was the first podcast we broadcast live while recording. Big ups to [WonderNetwork](https://wondernetwork.com/) for providing the streaming bandwidth, and [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/) for sponsoring the podcast. Keep an eye on the [@dev_hell Twitter account](http://twitter.com/dev_hell) for info on our next live stream.
