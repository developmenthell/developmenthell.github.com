On today's Very Special Episode of /dev/hell, we talk about Ed's struggles with depression and anxiety, and how it's impacted him as a member of the open source community. Yeah, we know, total buzzkill, but this is important stuff. We hope that by talking about it, folks with similar issues will be more likely to seek help.
