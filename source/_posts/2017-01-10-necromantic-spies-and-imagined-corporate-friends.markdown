YOUR 2016 PHP PODCAST OF THE YEAR from [simpleprogrammer.com](https://simpleprogrammer.com/podcast-awards/)

Welcome to the very first episode of 2017! We're back after a nice break for the holidays and ready to get back to being insightful and unfiltered.

In this episode we talked about the concept of "programming as craft" with Chris and Ed having a great discussion about what should follow after the phrase "programmers need to learn empathy."

Ed also released some music, and is donating all the proceeds to [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org). Chris was sad that he did not get the opportunity to re-record the vocal tracks from some of Ed's older material in his own [signature vocal style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_growl).

Chris also talked (not so briefly) about the new laptop he bought and the security measures he decided to take with it.
