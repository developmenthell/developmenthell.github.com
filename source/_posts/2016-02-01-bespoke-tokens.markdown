We really do appreciate our sponsors so when we get a chance to thank them in a way other than our awesome ad reads, we do it! On this episode you get twice the guest because we invited two of the three folks behind WonderNetworks to join us.

Paul Reinheimer and Gemma Anible came on (and even did video via Skype so they could tell when we were getting bored) and talked about how WonderNetworks got started, Paul and Gemma's preferred development style and Paul seemed determined (as he always is) to tweak Chris.
