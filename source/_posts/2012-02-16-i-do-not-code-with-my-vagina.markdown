Suffragettes rejoice because we have our first female guest. [Selena Deckelmann](https://twitter.com/selenamarie) bullied
her way onto the show to talk with us about Postgres, her lack of real Perl 
skills, Open Source Bridge and women in open source and technology in general.
She also proved that cheap laughs are always possible by picking on Canadians.
Also, how awesome it is that she shares a birthday with a famous NFL player.

Feel free to hit us up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dev_hell) or harass [Ed](https://twitter.com/funkatron) and [Chris](https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer) directly.
