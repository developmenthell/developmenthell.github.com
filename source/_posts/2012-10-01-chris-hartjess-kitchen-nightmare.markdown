EPISODE DOS EQUIS! Our 20th show goes out to all the haters. IN YOUR FACE HATERS.

This week we talk about how Chris sucks at cooking food, which segues nicely into a discussion of the True North PHP conference that he's co-organizing in Toronto in November. Thankfully he will not be catering the event himself. We also talk about Ed's move from doing PHP to Python for day-to-day work, and the plusses and minuses he's encountered during the transition.
