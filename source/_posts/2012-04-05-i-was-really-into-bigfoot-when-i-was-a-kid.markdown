This episode had us diving into the real-time web with [Nathan Fritz](https://github.com/fritzy), the Chief Architect for [&yet](http://andyet.net) and the main who has foolishly
agreed to help Chris learn the finer points of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). You can just hear the excitement in all our voices as we discuss Web 3.14159 aka the Real Time Web.
Nathan is one smart motherfucker so be prepared to have lots of knowledge exploded into your brain.

Nathan also discusses his previous life as a PHP guy, what XMPP is all about, and his book-in-progress on Lua scripting in Redis.
