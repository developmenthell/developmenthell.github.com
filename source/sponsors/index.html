<p>Sponsoring <strong>/dev/hell</strong> is a great way to support the developer community <em>and</em> raise awareness about your organization or product. Our listeners are smart, sophisticated, and loyal. They value honesty, sincerity, and quality. We are committed to working with sponsors with the same values.</p>

<p>Sponsorship normally gets you a mention/blurb at the beginning and end of the show, a listing in the episode post (which is included in the RSS feed), and your logo on our web site. We can also give out special promo codes and the like.</p>
